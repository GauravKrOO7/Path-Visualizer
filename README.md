# Description of the Project   
It focuses on graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm. The application offers an interactive and visually appealing interface that allows users to explore and understand these algorithms, also compare the working of these algorithms.

The application provides the functionality to generate a maze, which serves as the basis for testing the graph algorithms. Users can visualize the maze generation process and observe how the algorithms navigate through the maze to find the optimal path. The algorithms are implemented using JavaScript, allowing for real-time visualization and step-by-step explanations.

Object Oriented Programming Concepts are used while defining properties of the Board and Cell of the Maze.

The implemented algorithms determine and highlight the path between the two points. This feature enhances the user's understanding of how the algorithms operate and find the shortest or optimal path in various scenarios.

Overall, this project serves as an educational tool that combines interactive visualization with graph algorithms. 

It provides users with an engaging experience to explore and grasp the concepts of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, maze generation, and pathfinding.
