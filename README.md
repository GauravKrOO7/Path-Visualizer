# Path-Visualizer
Path - Visualizer in a Maze

This project is a front-end web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm. The application offers an interactive and visually appealing interface that allows users to explore and understand these algorithms.

The application provides the functionality to generate a maze, which serves as the basis for testing the graph algorithms. Users can visualize the maze generation process and observe how the algorithms navigate through the maze to find the optimal path. The algorithms are implemented using JavaScript, allowing for real-time visualization and step-by-step explanations.

Additionally, the application allows users to specify a start point and an end point within the maze. The implemented algorithms then determine and highlight the path between these two points. This feature enhances the user's understanding of how the algorithms operate and find the shortest or optimal path in various scenarios.

Overall, our project serves as an educational tool that combines interactive visualization with graph algorithms. It provides users with an engaging experience to explore and grasp the concepts of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, maze generation, and pathfinding.
